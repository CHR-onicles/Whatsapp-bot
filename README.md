# Whatsapp-bot

This is a whatsapp bot I created for EPiC Devs ([wait who?](#who-are-epic-devs)). It makes use of a Whatsapp web library and acts just like a regular user. It was built on top of a node server and is currently deployed to Heroku in order to make it available 24/7...or so I thought. Since I'm using a free Heroku dyno, I use cron-jobs to keep the dyno from sleeping and also to perform some *interesting* calculations at specific times.

## Overview

### The problem

Timetables are always a pain to memorize, going through hundreds of messages from class group chats to filter out important information is equally painful. But worst of them all is trooping all the way to class just to find out it was cancelled a few minutes/hours prior. I'm also sure we've all been through that moment where almost everyone forgets what exactly the assignment given was about or the exact deadline.

What if someone could always remind you when it's time for class on your favorite messaging platform? üòÆ

What if you don't have to ever memorize any timetable? üò™

What if someone always forwards important messages and links from class groups automatically to your dm? ü§Ø

What if someone always keeps track of your assignments and reminds you when it's close to the deadline?ü•∫

Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you.... <span style="font-size: 18px">"Ethereal"</span>, a whatsapp personal assistant... or bot if you will.

### My solution

<span style="font-size: 18px">Ethereal</span> seeks to make life easier for [EPiC Devs](#epic-devs) by:

- Forwarding important **announcements** and **links** from class groups to our private whatsapp group.
- Reminding us individually about the times we have class.
- Getting our timetable for the week, and for the current day depending on the elective each of us offers in as little as 4 quick interactions (*< 20secs*) or by typing 1 command (*< 10secs*); As opposed to annoyingly asking someone else who may or may not be available at that moment.
- Sending the resources we need for each course. _(not yet implemented)_
- Reminding and giving us detailed descriptions of assignments we have for each course. _(not yet implemented)_

Forgive the quality üôèüèΩ, Github requires videos to be <10mb which is a pain for a long one like this.

Made up for the low quality with good background music though! ü§ç

Oh and I couldn't add all the functionalities of the bot in the demo as it was getting way too long üò™

## Tips:

This project would be an interesting one to clone and run as it's heavily personalized but if you are up to the task, I recommend the following extensions in VS Code in order to have more insight into the codebase:

- [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) to see comments with keywords highlighted differently.

- [TODO.md Kanban Taskboard](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=coddx.coddx-alpha) to see my TODO list in a more elegant form.

Feel free to hit me up if you do have interest in it üëãüèΩ


PS:
As much this project was fun to build and has proven veryyy useful, I don't think it can stand the test of time for variousss technical reasons(eg: Heroku automatically restarting dynos every 24hours, meaning after 24 hours I would have to rescan my QR code...if I remember) and to that extent, I would stop maintaining it pretty soon. I'm also quite busy with my final year project and freelancing :(

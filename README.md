## Overview

### The problem

Timetables are always a pain to memorize, going through hundreds of messages from class group chats to filter out important information is equally painful. But worst of them all is trooping all the way to class just to find out it was cancelled a few minutes/hours prior. I'm sure we've all been through that moment where almost everyone forgets what exactly the assignment given was about or the exact deadline.

But...

What if someone could always remind us when it's time for class on your favorite messaging platform? ðŸ˜®

What if you don't have to ever memorize any timetable? ðŸ˜ª

What if someone always forwards important messages and links from class groups automatically to your dm? ðŸ¤¯

What if someone always keeps track of our assignments and reminds us when it's close to the deadline?ðŸ¥º

Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you.... **Ethereal**, a whatsapp personal assistant or bot.

### My solution

**Ethereal** seeks to make life easier for [EPiC Devs](#epic-devs) by:

- Forwarding important **announcements** and **links** from class groups to our private whatsapp group.
- Reminding us individually about the times we have class.
- Getting our timetable for the week, and for the current day depending on the elective each of us offers in as little as 4 quick interactions (< 30secs) or by typing 1 command (< 10secs); As opposed to annoyingly asking someone else who may or may not be available at that moment.
- Sending the resources we need for each course. _(not yet implemented)_
- Reminding and giving us detailed descriptions of assignments we have for each course. _(not yet implemented)_

### Tips:

I recommend the following extensions in VS Code in order to have more insight to the codebase:

- [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) to see comments with keywords highlighted differently.

- [TODO.md Kanban Taskboard](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=coddx.coddx-alpha) to see my TODO list in a more elegant form.

<em>[TODO.md spec & Kanban Board](https://bit.ly/3fCwKfM)</em>

### Todo

- [ ] ⭐❔ Add aliases for long commands, especially those that require other arguments  
- [ ] ⭐❔ Add command for last link/announcement sent => !last link || !last ann  
- [ ] ⭐❔ Add feature where bot performs basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division for now... chaining should come later  
- [ ] ⭐❔ Tell users something when they text "Hi" to the bot in dms? Maybe give them a list of the bot's commands.  
- [ ] ⭐❔ Add feature where in DEV environment, all dm-related and forwarding-related functionalities point to my DMs in order not to disturb other peeps and groups.  
- [ ] ⭐❔ Add feature where bot sends logs to my dm....basically all important console logs in the codebase  
- [ ] ⭐❔ Implement state where in development environment, development bot responds to only you, and does not perform certain functionalities that production bot would perform... like sending notifications  
- [ ] ⚠️❔ Add functionality to mute certain groups, meaning that it wont forward any messages or respond to commands from that particular group => !mute group...bonus if bot deletes approval message after some time like in Discord  
- [ ] ⭐ Add command to tell bot to forward messages(announcements & links) to user => !forward and !forward stop to stop forwarding messages  
- [ ] ⚠️Refactor extracting course name into function  
- [ ] ⚠️Refactor repeated variable setters to global variables  
- [ ] ⚠️Refactor code which extracts time from the courses object  

### In Progress

- [ ] ⭐❔ Create a list of the class whatsapp groups that can be gotten by !groups or something  
- [ ] ⭐❔ When forwarding links, forward the next consecutive message from the same user quoting the link/announcement as its usually more information about the announcement/link...refer to screenshot  
- [ ] ⚠️Implement command to stop notifications for a particular course. => !notify allow <course> || !notify stop <course>  
- [ ] ⭐Add command for bot to delete the last thing it sent => !del last , !del all to delete all bot responses in a chat that can be deleted for everyone  
- [ ] 👍Checkout other symbols as replacements for emojis

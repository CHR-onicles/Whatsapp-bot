<em>[TODO.md spec & Kanban Board](https://bit.ly/3fCwKfM)</em>

### Todo

- [ ] ⚠️ Replace "bot admin" with "bot mod" or "mod" to prevent conflict with "whatsapp admin" ... New level of hierarchy should be everyone -> mod -> Super mod -> Grandmaster  
- [ ] ⭐❔ Reply to incorrect commands in dms? Basically any word starting with "!" but doesn't execute any actual command  
- [ ] ⭐❔ Add feature where bot automatically deletes some admin command replies after carrying them out...like promotion or demotion  
- [ ] ⭐❔ Add command for bot to delete the last thing it sent => !del last , !del all to delete all bot responses in a chat that can be deleted for everyone  
- [ ] ⭐❔ Add aliases for long commands, especially those that require other arguments  
- [ ] ⭐❔ Add command for last link/announcement sent => !last link || !last ann  
- [ ] ⭐❔ Add feature where in DEV environment, all dm-related and forwarding-related functionalities point to my DMs in order not to disturb other peeps and groups.  
- [ ] ⭐❔ Add feature where bot sends logs to my dm....basically all important console logs in the codebase  
- [ ] ⭐❔ Implement state where in development environment, development bot responds to only you, and does not perform certain functionalities that production bot would perform... like sending notifications  
- [ ] ⚠️❔ Add functionality to mute certain groups, meaning that it wont forward any messages or respond to commands from that particular group => !mute group...bonus if bot deletes approval message after some time like in Discord  
- [ ] ⚠️Refactor extracting course name into function  
- [ ] ⚠️Refactor repeated variable setters to global variables  
- [ ] ⚠️Refactor code which extracts time from the courses object  
- [ ] ⚠️Implement command to stop notifications for a particular course. => !notify allow <course> || !notify stop <course>  

### In Progress

- [ ] ⚠️ Specify the range of numbers used for all the list_responses at the top of main.js  
- [ ] ⭐ Use custom fonts for footers of bot replies  
- [ ] ⭐ Add command to tell bot to forward messages(announcements & links) to user => !forward; and !forward stop to stop forwarding messages
